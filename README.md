# LFB-Analyss (London Fire Brigade fire incidences reported between 2012 and 2015)
#Created by Tania Sanchez (April-May 2016)

This set of codes contain the python codes used for the exploratory analysis of the LFB data (analysis.py) as well as the code used to predict the type of prperties with a higher risk within the London area.

The code used to perform the exploratory analysis and plots is 'analysis.py'
There are two codes used to perform the Bayes analysis 'Bayes.py' and 'Bayes.R' the former was used to compute the likelihood based on the location of previous fires and the entropy of the prediction. the latter was used to predict the fire risk and generate the heatmaps (exploratory section of the report and model).

Finally, the findings and relevant figures are presented in the document 'report.pdf'

The plots are saved in the folder labelled as 'Plots'
